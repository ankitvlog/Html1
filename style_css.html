    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>Paragraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic. It is a very important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, 
    be it an answer, essay, story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing.The purposes of the paragraph are to give 
    information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to convince someone that our idea is right.</p>
    <p>A topic sentence is a precise statement that reflects the main idea of the paragraph. It should be carefully written as it will show the reader what you are going to 
    talk about. Words chosen for this should not be cluttered and ambiguous as readers will decide to read further based on this. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a list item in an unordered list.</li>
      <li>This is another list item.</li>
      <li>And yet again, this is a list item.</li>
    </ul>
